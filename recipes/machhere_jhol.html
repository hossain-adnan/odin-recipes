    <h5>A delicate Bengali fish curry. In India, the best parts of a fish are often reserved as a fillet and served grilled, 
        broiled, or cooked alongside a fish stew or curry containing the less attractive portions of fish.</h5>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds thick whitefish fillets, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the tomatoes, cumin, turmeric, salt, and water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook the fish in the oiled skillet until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Simmer until the flavors integrate, about 10 minutes more. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
